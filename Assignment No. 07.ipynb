    "1.) What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- re.complie()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- Raw strings appears so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- The search() method will return None if the regex pattern is not found in the string. If the pattern is found, \n",
    "         the search() method returns a match object.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         \n",
    "4.) From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- If a match item is not the null value None, we can call group() on the match item to return the match result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover?\n",
    "    Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer:- Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, \n",
    "         and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.) In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:- using backslash: \\., \\(, and \\)\n",
    "\n",

    "7.) The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
    "    the two options?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "Answer:- If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, \n",

    "         explained below \n",
    "         \n",
    "         When called on a regex with no groups, such as \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d, the method findall() returns a list of              string matches, such as ['(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d)', '(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d)'].\n",

    "8.) In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- The | character is called a pipe. You can use it anywhere you want to match one of many expressions. For example,       the regular expressions r'Nawab|Taj Hasan' will match either 'Nawab' or 'Taj Hasan'.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "9.) In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.) In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",

    "11.) What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "12.) What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
    "     expressions? \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "Answer:-  \\d in a regex stands for a digit character - that is, any single numberal 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "           \\w means any letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character.\n",

    "         The dot-star will match everything except a newline. \n",
    "         By passing re.DOTALL as the second argument to re.compile(), \n",
