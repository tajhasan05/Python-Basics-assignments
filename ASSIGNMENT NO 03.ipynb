    "# 1.) Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: functions are advantageous because this makes program shorter and in python programming, function stop us writing \n",
    "        same logic various times. function debug the program faster and better. it is easy to read \n",
    "        and very easy to update and provide a better efficiency of a program.\n",

    "# 2.) When does the code in a function run: when its specified or when its called? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A code in a function run when the function is called not when it is specified.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 3.) What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The def keyword is a statement for defining a function in Python. we start a function with the def keyword,\n",
    "        specify a name followed by a colon (:) sign.\n",

    "# 4.) What is the difference between a function and a function call? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: function:- A function is nothing but just a set of statements which is written as a block to \n",
    "                   perform a specific type of job.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        function call:- Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call.\n",

    "# 5.) How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program                   terminates and all its names are forgotten. And a local scope is created whenever a function is called.\n",

    "# 6.) What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: when the function call returns the local variables are destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.)What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task.\n",
    "        or we can say the values that a function returns when it has completed.  \n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: code which is having an error goes to try clause. \n",
    "        and the main purpose of the except clause is, the code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.\n",
